## Features

- **Shaped seat** with trapezoidal outline (front/back arcs, angled sides), dual comfort scoops, and filleted edges
- **4 splayed/raked legs** with turned profiles (tenon, shoulder, taper) via revolve, positioned from seat corner geometry
- **H-stretcher system** — side stretchers connect front-to-back legs, cross stretcher connects side stretchers, all body-referenced via `intersectWithSketchPlane`
- **7 curved back spindles** arranged on a comfort arc, raked backward
- **Swept crest rail** following the spindle top arc
- **Tenon extensions** on all leg and stretcher ends
- **Through-tenon wedges** at all 10 joints (4 leg-to-seat, 4 stretcher-to-leg, 2 cross-stretcher-to-side-stretcher) using `tenon_wedge` template with `end_face=` for compound angles
- **Multi-species appearance** — white oak body, rosewood wedges, grain-aligned via principal axes of inertia

| `tw_dr` | 1/2 | Wedge depth ratio |

## Parametric Behavior

Each leg is positioned from its own seat corner: `leg_to_edge` along the near side edge, then `leg_to_edge` perpendicular inward. All four legs are built **independently** by `build_leg` (its `front_y`/`side_x` args select the corner) rather than mirrored — see Build Status below for why. Stretchers are built with the `turned_stretcher` template from the leg axes (`_leg_axis` through each leg's end circles): the two side stretchers connect front-to-back legs at `str_z` height, the cross stretcher connects the side stretchers. Wedges are added per joint. Positions derive from shared parameters so geometry follows parameter changes.

## Wedge Notes

- Leg-to-seat wedges pass `grain_dir=(0, 1, 0)` because the seat is nearly square (18" x 15") — auto-detection is ambiguous
- Stretcher wedges use auto-detected grain via principal axes of inertia — works correctly for splayed legs and angled stretchers
- FL and BL legs are wedged independently (not mirrored from FL) to ensure correct slot orientation on each side of the angled mirror plane

## Build Status (2026-07-05)

`validate_design` status: **interference PASS (0), featureImpact PASS, deps
dependency-tree PASS**; still failing: **connectivity** (round turned joints, see
below — an accepted limitation) and **deps sketch-traceability** (sketches not yet
fully-constrained/anchored — in progress). Progress this round:

- **featureImpact → PASS.** Legs are now built FLUSH (`build_leg(proud=False)`), so
  the trim needs no split/rejoin on them — that stops their foot chamfer and wedge
  slot cut from being orphaned (a split+rejoined body loses its features' face
  associations → they read as zero-impact). Redundant wedge→mortise cuts (the wedge
  sits in the socket void) were removed. Stretcher wedge slot cuts are DEFERRED
  (`tenon_wedge.round_tenon(defer_cut=True)`) until after the stretcher's flush-trim,
  so they stay the last feature and aren't orphaned.
- **Connectivity 8 → 4 clusters.** Flush leg tenons + cutting the seat with each leg
  wedge give the legs planar contact with the seat, so all four legs, the wedges, the
  spindles and the crest now form one 17-body cluster. The three stretcher
  sub-assemblies remain separate (round tenons — see below).
- **Clean body names + deps tree PASS.** No split/rejoin means legs keep their names
  (`Leg_FL`…`Leg_BR`), so `model.json`'s `Leg_* → Seat` rows resolve.

### Earlier (2026-07-04)

The example was committed **unvalidated** (`3273fc7 WIP: fan-out anchor drafts …`)
and did not build. Fixed:

- **Line-770 anchoring over-constraint** (`VCS_SKETCH_SOLVING_FAILED`). The
  side-edge mirror-plane sketch drew a construction line between the seat's
  front-left (0,0) and back-left corners, then projected the whole seat outline —
  whose left edge is the *same* line — and pinned the drawn line's endpoints onto
  the fixed projected duplicate (one endpoint on the origin), over-constraining the
  projected-geometry solve. Now the projected left edge is reused directly for the
  path (no drawn duplicate, no coincidence).
- **Mirror-recompute corruption.** Legs and the right stretcher were mirrored, then
  the trim phase split/combined them — Fusion regenerated the mirrors and scrambled
  body identities (`Leg_FL → "Leg_FR (1) (1)"`), making the per-leg seat mortise and
  wedge cuts miss. Now all four legs and both side stretchers are built
  **independently** (`build_leg` takes `front_y`/`side_x` to anchor to any corner),
  so body references stay stable through the trim.
- **Interference 18 → 0.** Added spindle→seat and spindle→crest **socket cuts**
  (spindles were full cylinders interpenetrating both). The crest+spindles+seat are
  now one connected cluster.

### Remaining (NOT yet green)

1. **Connectivity: 4 clusters, need 1** — the three stretcher sub-assemblies
   (`Str_Left`, `Str_Right`, `Str_Cross`, each with its wedges) remain separate.
   `check_connectivity` counts only **planar** face contact, and the round stretcher
   tenons into the round legs / round cross-into-side have only cylindrical contact.
   The legs reached the seat cluster because their FLUSH tenons + wedge-cut sockets
   give a little planar contact (though weak, <1 cm² on the front legs). Fully closing
   this needs the stretcher joints reworked to blind flat-bottomed mortises — the
   joinery tradeoff the maintainer chose to defer (keep the wedges).
2. **deps: sketch traceability** — ~7 sketch-creation sites produce non-anchored or
   under-constrained sketches: `build_leg`'s `Leg_*_Prof`, the seat outline
   `Seat_Sk`, `ScoopPath_Sk`, the spindle `Spin_*_Prof`, the crest sketches, plus the
   shared `turned_stretcher` (windsor-only, safe to edit) and `tenon_wedge` (used by
   8+ examples → any anchoring must be opt-in). Each fix anchors/​fully-constrains one
   site (fixes all its instances).
